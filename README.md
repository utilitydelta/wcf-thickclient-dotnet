# wcf-thickclient-dotnet
Ultra fast .NET n-tier thick client

# WORK IN PROGRESS COME BACK LATER :)

## Goals
Have you ever needed to build a thick client? Did you add an app server into the architecture? This repo shows you how to implement this!

- Authenticated backend with custom username/password authentication & token management via WCF
- Pure binary transfer over encrypted TCP for ultimate speed, capacity and security
- Encrypted messaging via SSL certificates
- Service driven approach with shared server & client assemblies for developer productivity. Program against a .NET interface instead of WCF service references
